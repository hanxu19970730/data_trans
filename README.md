本私仓创建的目的旨在对蓝区CI环境模型生成的结果文件（包括但不限于*.html、*.csv等格式）进行传输，以便于在非linux命令行环境内打开查看结果并进行分析。

本仓严格遵守蓝区与黄、绿区环境数据隔离原则，非蓝区产生代码、数据、图片等资源严禁传入私仓进行数据传输等行为，违者后果自负！

The purpose of creating this private repository is to facilitate the transmission of result files generated by the Blue Zone CI environment model (including but not limited to formats such as *.html, *.csv, etc.), enabling the opening, viewing, and analysis of results in non-Linux command-line environments.

This repository strictly adheres to the principle of isolating environment data between the Blue Zone and the Yellow and Green Zones. It is strictly prohibited to transmit code, data, images, and other resources generated outside the Blue Zone into this private repository for data transmission or any other activities. Violators will bear the consequences themselves!
